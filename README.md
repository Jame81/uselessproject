## Basic Details
### Team Name: Oli's Play


### Team Members

### Project Description
WEIRDO ME is a playful text jumbler that allows users to shuffle letters in words while preserving spaces and punctuation. Users can type or upload text and download the jumbled version as a .txt file, all while enjoying a spooky animated background.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world where text remains overly structured, many have suffered from boredom due to predictable writing. This project humorously tackles the 'crisis of creativity' in everyday writing.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing WEIRDO ME - because why write normally when you can jumble your words into an unrecognizable mess? The program jumbles alternate words, making even the most mundane sentences feel like a cryptic puzzle.

The demo video shows a user typing text into the app, saving it as a .txt file, and then opening it to reveal scrambled words. This illustrates the core function of "WEIRDO ME - Text Jumbler" in transforming standard text into a playful, randomized format.

## Team Contributions
- Olivia Mary James: Designed the UI and implemented the text jumbling logic.
- Ashbin K George: Developed the backend using Flask and integrated the text file upload/download functionality.
- Merin Sara Mathew: Created the graphics and animations to enhance the user experience.
